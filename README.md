The purpose of this website is to track and display my progress in projects and provide my background. I started as a scratch coder making silly games years ago and dabbled in some python. Following a major switch a couple years ago for Computer science I have since imporved my programming skills dramatically and wanted to start tracking my progress and monitering my projects. I love solving all sorts of problems with code but game making (board or video games) has always been the side I'm most passionate about. I plan to soon (after I get a little bit more experience and time) make my own game and in the meantime, graduate from BYU learning as much as I can along the way.

## Content Creation side project

Minecraft Speedrunning, video editing
- https://www.youtube.com/@duckyith
- https://www.twitch.tv/duckyith
- https://discord.gg/PB9kCufB
- Saw a need for easy to undertand, all in one place begginner tutorials for speedrunning minecraft (something I was passionate about and had trouble finding)
- Made a twitch, youtube, discord platform and grew to 100 followers on twitch with a few regulars and 10k views on my best video (not particularly impressive but for a quick side project for fun I'm proud of the progress I made and the platforms I built)
- Never finished all of my tutorials but I still get messages from players who need help and plan to return some day
- also worked on a speedrun mod for a bit that is also unfinished and I would like to return to
